# 3_link_manipulator
This project is a 3-link robotic arm controlled by an ESP32 microcontroller, using ST3215 serial bus servos and a Waveshare General Motor Driver. It reads predefined joint angles from a CSV file and implements inverse kinematics for precise positioning. The system is designed for automation, robotics research, and motion control applications.
